# 692. Top K Frequent Words

## Problem Link
[LeetCode Problem 692](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= words.length <= 500`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique words]`.

## Examples:

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```java
words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
```

**Output:**
```java
["i","love"]
```

**Explanation:**
- "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
- Since both words have the same frequency, "i" comes before "love" due to lexicographical order.

## Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) {
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each word
        HashMap<String, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            mp.put(word, mp.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Step 2: Create a list of unique words
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>(mp.keySet());

        // Step 3: Sort the words by frequency, and lexicographically for ties
        Collections.sort(ans, (a, b) -> {
            if (mp.get(a).equals(mp.get(b))) {
                // If two strings have the same frequency, sort in lexicographical order
                return a.compareTo(b);
            }
            // Sort by frequency in descending order
            return mp.get(b) - mp.get(a);
        });

        // Step 4: Return the top k words
        return ans.subList(0, k);
    }
}
```
### Time Complexity:
- **Counting Frequency:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of words.
- **Sorting:** `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of unique words.
- Overall: `O(n + m log m)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **HashMap:** `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of unique words.
- **Sorting List:** `O(m)`.
